<h2>Description</h2>

<p>I have never tasted better cookies than these. They're just incredible tasty and very easy to make.
    You'll be so surprised once you taste them too.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup sugar</li>
    <li>¾ cup brown sugar, packed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>4 ounces milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
    <li>4 ounces dark chocolate chunks (or your preference)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>1. Precalenta el horno a 350 F</li>
    <li>2. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste has formed with no lumps. Fijate que el azucar moreno no esté tan pegado para que no te cueste</li>
    <li>3. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk.</li>
    <li>4. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix too much. This will cause the gluten in the flour to toughen which will result in cakier cookies.</li>
    <li>5. Fold in the chocolate chunks evenly, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
    <li>6. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches of space between cookies and 2 inches of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
    <li>7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. Cool completely, and enjoy!</li>
